Data Structures

This repository contains all my assignments and projects for the Data Structures course 
at Northeastern University during my Masters in Computer Science.

In this course, I learned different data structures(Stacks, Queues, Singly and Doubly Linked Lists, 
Trees, Graphs, HashMaps, Heaps, Priority Queues), different algorithms(sort algorithms as well as analysis, 
greedy algorithm, dynamic programming) as well as their analysis and basic networking knowledge in Linux environment.
